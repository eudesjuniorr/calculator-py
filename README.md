# calculator-py
 creating a calculator using only python


# checklist of what to do yet:
1.add new functions -- ✓
2.resize the button of functions -- ✓
3.add more functions -- ✓
4.added a history of calculation -- loading...

# next fixes after my returns with the project:

**1.** solve the problem with click on the equal button without numbers in the number_input variable or when the user clicks on the equal button having the just dot or the dot plus a number in the number_input variable -- ✓

**2.** solve the problem when the user clicks on any function button without a number in the number_input variable, in this case, the terminal return an error message. -- ✓

**3.** insert the potentiation in cases where the result is so long -- ✓

**4.** solve the problem that the system does not delete the message of error after the user inserts just one number or one number plus signal of operation and clicks on the equal button and before he inserts the numbers again -- loading...

**just this for now**
