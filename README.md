 creating a calculator using only python


checklist of what to do yet:
1.add new functions -- ✓
2.resize the button of functions -- ✓
3.add more functions -- ✓
4.added a history of calculation -- loading...

next fixes after my returns with the project:
1.solve the problem with click on the equal button without numbers in the number_input variable or when the user click on the equal button having the dot plus a number in the number_input variable -- loading...
2.solve the problem when the user clicks on any function button without a number in the number_input variable, in this case, the terminal return an error message. -- loading...
**just this for now**
