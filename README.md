# calculator-py
creating a calculator using only python


# checklist of what to do yet:
**1.** add new functions -- ✓

**2.** resize the button of functions -- ✓

**3.** add more functions -- ✓

**4.** added a history of calculation -- ✓

# next fixes after my returns with the project:

**1.** solve the problem with click on the equal button without numbers in the number_input variable or when the user clicks on the equal button having the just dot or the dot plus a number in the number_input variable -- ✓

**2.** solve the problem when the user clicks on any function button without a number in the number_input variable, in this case, the terminal return an error message. -- ✓

**3.** insert the potentiation in cases where the result is so long -- ✓

**4.** solve the problem that the system does not delete the message of error after the user inserts just one number or one number plus signal of operation and clicks on the equal button and before he inserts the numbers again -- ✓

**5.** About the fourth goal after my returns, I can solve it by creating some functions and reorganizing the code body of the window style. However, some errors remained to be resolved. I will list the errors next: the operations that have your result given by your own button, for example, the potentiation, and the factorial, need individual changes, directly on your base code of the function. The next step is to solve this problem. -- ✓ 

**5.1** I solved the problem of the factorial, but the potentiation still needs to be solved. -- ✓

**5.2** solve the problem of the potentiation -- ✓

**5.3** solve the problem of the log -- ✓

**6.** solve the problem that shows just the first number plus the signal of operation in the history of calculation before the user finishes the operation and clicks the equal button -- ✓

**7.** solve the problem that shows "inf" at the history display when the result is too long -- ✓

**8.** fix the problem that shows the error message when the user tries make two operations at the same time, for example, 2 + 2 + 2 -- loading...

**9.** upgrade the handle_keyrpess function to make the calculator more intuitive and make work it -- ✓

**just this for now**
